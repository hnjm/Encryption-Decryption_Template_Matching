# Encryption-Decryption_Template_Matching
This is a project written in C that encrypts a BMP file, deciphers it and is doing a template matching for the numbers between 0 and 9
There is a .txt file called "secret_key.txt" which contains the seed for creating randomly generated numbers and the actual secret key used in ecrypting the values of the pixels.
